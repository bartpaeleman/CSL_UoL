About Harvard Referencing, CSL and Citing Tools

Are any of you using tools for creating a bibliography or for automated referencing? I started using Zotero (found a link in the Library), which is an add-on in my Firefox browser . It allows me to collect and group content while researching to build my library for the assignment I work on, and by installing a plugin for your word processor (http://www.zotero.org/support/word_processor_plugin_installation_for_zotero_2.1) you can automate some of the work to create your reference list.
Now the ting is... you can find loads of different referencing style files (even many different ones for Harvard Referencing, from various Universities) that are built on a standard called "Citation Style Language". This XML-based file is used in Zotero and Mendeley Desktop, and is easy modifiable.
Unfortunately I could find no style file for the University of Liverpool, so I started building one that I am now using based on an existing file that is available for the University of Staffordshire (created by Chris Hastie). I am in the process of modifying it for UoL use, under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 license terms.
It is not 100% complete and I still need to do some adjustments in my work, manual checks and corrections after building a bibliography using this in my (Microsoft Word 2010) word processor, but it sure gets you started (and auto-sorts the bibliography based on the Author last name).
Here is some background and links to pages I have used so far: http://support.mekentosj.com/discussions/questions/13790-creating-citation-styles
I also found a very interesting online visual CSL editor: http://steveridout.com/csl/visualEditor/
For anyone interested to use it, if you extend the code or find errors that can improve this for the benefit of us all, please do share it here!

Enjoy... 



For those who want to get started, here is a quick ‘n’ dirty installation guide for Zotero, but if you happen to use Mendeley as your Referencing software, it also can use my CSL file.
(only useful if you have Firefox browser with Zotero extension):

    1. Save the CSL file on GitHub called: harvard-liverpool-university.csl
    2. Drag the file on a firefox window
    3. When FF asks to install, confirm
    4. Go into Zotero Preferences / Cite / Styles
    5. Select the Harvard – University of Liverpool one as default
    6. Install the Zotero word processor add-in
    7. Start using (per manuals on Zotero website)
